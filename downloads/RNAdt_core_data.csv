dsRNA-seq,2010,Double-stranded RNA sequencing,Genome-Wide Double-Stranded RNA Sequencing Reveals the Functional Significance of Base-Paired RNAs in Arabidopsis,"Zheng Q, Ryvkin P, Li F, Dragomir I, Valladares O, et al.","The functional structure of all biologically active molecules is dependent on intra- and inter-molecular interactions. This is especially evident for RNA molecules whose functionality, maturation, and regulation require formation of correct secondary structure through encoded base-pairing interactions. Unfortunately, intra- and inter-molecular base-pairing information is lacking for most RNAs. Here, we marry classical nuclease-based structure mapping techniques with high-throughput sequencing technology to interrogate all base-paired RNA in Arabidopsis thaliana and identify ~200 new small (sm)RNA–producing substrates of RNA–DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6. Our comprehensive analysis of paired RNAs reveals conserved functionality within introns and both 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, as well as a novel population of functional RNAs, many of which are the precursors of smRNAs. Finally, we identify intra-molecular base-pairing interactions to produce a genome-wide collection of RNA secondary structure models. Although our methodology reveals the pairing status of RNA molecules in the absence of cellular proteins, previous studies have demonstrated that structural information obtained for RNAs in solution accurately reflects their structure in ribonucleoprotein complexes. Furthermore, our identification of RNA–DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6 substrates and conserved functional RNA domains within introns and both 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs using this approach strongly suggests that RNA molecules are correctly folded into their secondary structure in solution. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of base-paired RNAs in eukaryotes and present an approach that should be widely applicable for the analysis of this key structural feature of RNA.",GSE23439,10.1371/journal.pgen.1001141,RNase One,Enzyme,Phosphate backbone,Single stranded,Cleavage,In vitro,Transcriptome-wide,Secondary,At2g07698 and At4g02510 transcripts,Arabidopsis thaliana,_NA_,_NA_

To accelerate RNA structure inference, we developed fragmentation sequencing (FragSeq), a high-throughput RNA structure probing method that uses high-throughput RNA sequencing of fragments generated by digestion with nuclease P1, which specifically cleaves single-stranded nucleic acids. In experiments probing the entire mouse nuclear transcriptome, we accurately and simultaneously mapped single-stranded RNA regions in multiple ncRNAs with known structure. We probed in two cell types to verify reproducibility.

Chang & Eran Segal","The structures of RNA molecules are often important for their function and regulation, yet there are no experimental techniques for genome-scale measurement of RNA structure. Here we describe a novel strategy termed parallel analysis of RNA structure (PARS), which is based on deep sequencing fragments of RNAs that were treated with structure-specific enzymes, thus providing simultaneous in vitro profiling of the secondary structure of thousands of RNA species at single nucleotide resolution. We apply PARS to profile the secondary structure of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and obtain structural profiles for over 3,000 distinct transcripts. Analysis of these profiles reveals several RNA structural properties of yeast transcripts, including the existence of more secondary structure over coding regions compared with untranslated regions, a three-nucleotide periodicity of secondary structure across coding regions and an anti-correlation between the efficiency with which an mRNA is translated and the structure over its translation start site. PARS is readily applicable to other organisms and to profiling RNA structure in diverse conditions, thus enabling studies of the dynamics of secondary structure at a genomic scale.",GSE22393,10.1038/nature09322,"RNase V1, S1",Enzyme,Phosphodiester bond,"Single stranded (S1), double stranded (V1)",Cleavage,In vitro,Transcriptome-wide,Secondary,"CCW12, RPL41A, ASH1, URE2",Yeast,<img alt='pars fig' src='../images/pars.jpg'>,4611171285662
CLASH,2011,"Crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids","Cross-linking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids reveals RNA–RNA interactions in yeast","Grzegorz Kudla, Sander Granneman, Daniela Hahn, Jean D. Beggs, and David Tollervey","Many protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid interactions have been experimentally characterized, whereas RNA–RNA interactions have generally only been predicted computationally. Here, we describe a high-throughput method to identify intramolecular and intermolecular RNA–RNA interactions experimentally by cross-linking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH). As validation, we identified 39 known target sites for box C/D modification-guide small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) on the yeast pre-rRNA. Novel snoRNA-rRNA hybrids were recovered between snR4-5S and U14-25S. These are supported by native electrophoresis and consistent with previously unexplained data. The U3 snoRNA was found to be associated with sequences close to the 3′ side of the central pseudoknot in 18S rRNA, supporting a role in formation of this structure. Applying CLASH to the yeast U2 spliceosomal snRNA led to a revised predicted secondary structure, featuring alternative folding of the 3′ domain and long-range contacts between the 3′ and 5′ domains. CLASH should allow transcriptome-wide analyses of RNA–RNA interactions in many organisms.",Request from the authors,10.1073/pnas.1017386108,_NA_,Crosslinking and ligation,_NA_,Double stranded,_NA_,In vivo,Transcriptome-wide,Secondary,U2,Yeast,<img alt='clash fig' src='../images/clash.jpg'>,Granted by PNAS Executive Editor Diane Sullenberger

Lucks, Stefanie A. Mortimer, Cole Trapnell, Shujun Luo, Sharon Aviran, Gary P. Schroth, Lior Pachter, Jennifer A. Doudna, and Adam P. Arkin","New regulatory roles continue to emerge for both natural and engineered noncoding RNAs, many of which have specific secondary and tertiary structures essential to their function. Thus there is a growing need to develop technologies that enable rapid characterization of structural features within complex RNA populations. We have developed a high-throughput technique, SHAPE-Seq, that can simultaneously measure quantitative, single nucleotide-resolution secondary and tertiary structural information for hundreds of RNA molecules of arbitrary sequence. SHAPE-Seq combines selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry with multiplexed paired-end deep sequencing of primer extension products. This generates millions of sequencing reads, which are then analyzed using a fully automated data analysis pipeline, based on a rigorous maximum likelihood model of the SHAPE-Seq experiment. We demonstrate the ability of SHAPE-Seq to accurately infer secondary and tertiary structural information, detect subtle conformational changes due to single nucleotide point mutations, and simultaneously measure the structures of a complex pool of different RNA molecules. SHAPE-Seq thus represents a powerful step toward making the study of RNA secondary and tertiary structures high throughput and accessible to a wide array of scientific pursuits, from fundamental biological investigations to engineering RNA for synthetic biological systems.",Request from the authors,10.1073/pnas.1106501108,1M7,Chemical,Ribose 2'-OH,Single stranded,RT stop,In vitro,Transcriptome-wide,Secondary and tertiary,RNase P specificity domain,Bacillus subtilis,<img alt='shape-seq fig' src='../images/shape-seq.jpg'>,Granted by PNAS Executive Editor Diane Sullenberger

However, the global influence of RNA folding in eukaryotes is still unclear. Here, we use a high-throughput, sequencing-based, structure-mapping approach to identify the paired (double-stranded RNA [dsRNA]) and unpaired (single-stranded RNA [ssRNA]) components of the Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans transcriptomes, which allows us to identify conserved features of RNA secondary structure in metazoans. From this analysis, we find that ssRNAs and dsRNAs are significantly correlated with specific epigenetic modifications. Additionally, we find key structural patterns across protein-coding transcripts that indicate that RNA folding demarcates regions of protein translation and likely affects microRNA-mediated regulation of mRNAs in animals. Finally, we identify and characterize 546 mRNAs whose folding pattern is significantly correlated between these metazoans, suggesting that their structure has some function.

Here, we reveal a layer of transcriptome organization in the form of RNA folding energies. By probing yeast RNA structures at different temperatures, we obtained relative melting temperatures (Tm) for RNA structures in over 4000 transcripts. Specific signatures of RNA Tm demarcated the polarity of mRNA open reading frames and highlighted numerous candidate regulatory RNA motifs in 3′ untranslated regions. RNA Tm distinguished noncoding versus coding RNAs and identified mRNAs with distinct cellular functions. We identified thousands of putative RNA thermometers, and their presence is predictive of the pattern of RNA decay in vivo during heat shock. The exosome complex recognizes unpaired bases during heat shock to degrade these RNAs, coupling intrinsic structural stabilities to gene regulation.

Hector, Elena Burlacu, Stuart Aitken, Thierry Le Bihan, Maarten Tuijtel, Alina Zaplatina, Atlanta G. Cook, Sander Granneman","Ribosome assembly in eukaryotes involves the activity of hundreds of assembly factors that direct the hierarchical assembly of ribosomal proteins and numerous ribosomal RNA folding steps. However, detailed insights into the function of assembly factors and ribosomal RNA folding events are lacking. To address this, we have developed ChemModSeq, a method that combines structure probing, high-throughput sequencing and statistical modeling, to quantitatively measure RNA structural rearrangements during the assembly of macromolecular complexes. By applying ChemModSeq to purified 40S assembly intermediates we obtained nucleotide-resolution maps of ribosomal RNA flexibility revealing structurally distinct assembly intermediates and mechanistic insights into assembly dynamics not readily observed in cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions. We show that RNA restructuring events coincide with the release of assembly factors and predict that completion of the head domain is required before the Rio1 kinase enters the assembly pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that 40S assembly factors regulate the timely incorporation of ribosomal proteins by delaying specific folding steps in the 3′ major domain of the 20S pre-ribosomal RNA.",GSE52878,10.1093/nar/gku815,"In vitro (1M7, DMS); In vivo (NAI)",Chemical,"1M7 (2'-OH), DMS (N1A, N3C), NAI (2'-OH)",Single stranded,RT stop,In vivo and in vitro,rRNA molecules,Secondary,18S rRNA,Yeast,<img alt='chemodseq fig' src='../images/chemmodseq.jpg'>,CC BY
CIRS-seq,2014,Chemical inference of RNA structures followed by massive parallel sequencing,Genome-wide profiling of mouse RNA secondary structures reveals key features of the mammalian transcriptome,"Danny Incarnato, Francesco Neri, Francesca Anselmi and Salvatore Oliviero","Background: The understanding of RNA structure is a key feature toward the comprehension of RNA functions and mechanisms of action. In particular, non-coding RNAs are thought to exert their functions by specific secondary structures, but an efficient annotation on a large scale of these structures is still missing. Results: By using a novel high-throughput method, named chemical inference of RNA structures, CIRS-seq, that uses dimethyl sulfate, and N-cyclohexyl- N'-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate to modify RNA residues in single-stranded conformation within native deproteinized RNA secondary structures, we investigate the structural features of mouse embryonic stem cell transcripts. Our analysis reveals an unexpected higher structuring of the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions compared to the coding regions, a reduced structuring at the Kozak sequence and stop codon, and a three-nucleotide periodicity across the coding region of messenger RNAs. We also observe that ncRNAs exhibit a higher degree of structuring with respect to protein coding transcripts. Moreover, we find that the Lin28a binding protein binds selectively to RNA motifs with a strong preference toward a single stranded conformation. Conclusions: This work defines for the first time the complete RNA structurome of mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing an extremely distinct RNA structural landscape. These results demonstrate that CIRS-seq constitutes an important tool for the identification of native deproteinized RNA structures.",GSE54106,10.1186/s13059-014-0491-2,"DMS, CMCT",Chemical,"CMCT (N1G, N3U); DMS (N1A, N3C)",Single stranded,RT stop,In vivo,Transcriptome-wide,Secondary,"mt-Te, U5 snRNA",Mouse,<img alt='cirs-seq fig' src='../imagges/cirs-seq.jpg'>,CC BY 4.0
DMS-seq,2014,_NA_,Genome-wide probing of RNA structure reveals active unfolding of mRNA structures in vivo,"Silvi Rouskin, Meghan Zubradt, Stefan Washietl, Manolis Kellis & Jonathan S. Weissman","RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by RNA’s ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and thus has motivated extensive computational1,2 and experimental3,4,5,6,7,8 efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in vivo5. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine residues9, followed by deep sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome10. Comparison between in vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA structure in vivo.",GSE45803,10.1038/nature12894,DMS,Chemical,"N1A, N3C",Single stranded,RT stop,In vivo and in vitro,Transcriptome-wide,Secondary,"HAC1, RPS28B, and ASH1",Yeast,<img alt='dms-seq fig1' src='../images/dms-seq.jpg'>,4616940566453
HRF-seq,2014,Parallel-sequencing-based method for probing RNA accessibility with hydroxyl radicals,Massive parallel-sequencing-based hydroxyl radical probing of RNA accessibility,"Lukasz Jan Kielpinski, Jeppe Vinther ","Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting (HRF) is a tried-and-tested method for analysis of the tertiary structure of RNA and for identification of protein footprints on RNA. The hydroxyl radical reaction breaks accessible parts of the RNA backbone, thereby allowing ribose accessibility to be determined by detection of reverse transcriptase termination sites. Current methods for HRF rely on reverse transcription of a single primer and detection by fluorescent fragments by capillary electrophoresis. Here, we describe an accurate and efficient massive parallel-sequencing-based method for probing RNA accessibility with hydroxyl radicals, called HRF-Seq. Using random priming and a novel barcoding scheme, we show that HRF-Seq dramatically increases the throughput of HRF experiments and facilitates the parallel analysis of multiple RNAs or experimental conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that HRF-Seq data for the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA correlates well with the ribose accessible surface area as determined by X-ray crystallography and have a resolution that readily allows the difference in accessibility caused by exposure of one side of RNA helices to be observed.",http://people.binf.ku.dk/jvinther/data/HRF-Seq/,10.1093/nar/gku167,Hydroxyl radical,Chemical,Ribose C4' and C5',Solvant accessible part,RT stop,In vitro,Multiple RNAs,Tertiary,16S rRNA,Escherichia coli,<img alt='hrf-seq fig1' src='../images/hrf-seq.jpeg'>,CC BY

Pioneering work by Lucks and colleagues has expanded this method to probe hundreds of molecules at once on an Illumina sequencing platform, obviating the use of slab gels or capillary electrophoresis on one molecule at a time. Here, we describe optimizations to this method from our lab, resulting in the MAP-seq protocol (Multiplexed Accessibility Probing read out through sequencing), version 1.0. The protocol permits the quantitative probing of thousands of RNAs at once, by several chemical modification reagents, on the time scale of a day using a tabletop Illumina machine. This method and a software package MAPseeker (http://simtk.org/home/map_seeker) address several potential sources of bias, by eliminating PCR steps, improving ligation efficiencies of ssDNA adapters, and avoiding problematic heuristics in prior algorithms.

Mod-seq,2014,_NA_,Mod-seq: high-throughput sequencing for chemical probing of RNA structure,"Jason Talkish, Gemma May, Yizhu Lin, John L. Woolford, Jr., and C. Joel McManus ","The functions of RNA molecules are intimately linked to their ability to fold into complex secondary and tertiary structures. Thus, understanding how these molecules fold is essential to determining how they function. Current methods for investigating RNA structure often use small molecules, enzymes, or ions that cleave or modify the RNA in a solvent-accessible manner. While these methods have been invaluable to understanding RNA structure, they can be fairly labor intensive and often focus on short regions of single RNAs. Here we present a new method (Mod-seq) and data analysis pipeline (Mod-seeker) for assaying the structure of RNAs by high-throughput sequencing. This technique can be utilized both in vivo and in vitro, with any small molecule that modifies RNA and consequently impedes reverse transcriptase. As proof-of-principle, we used dimethyl sulfate (DMS) to probe the in vivo structure of total cellular RNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mod-seq analysis simultaneously revealed secondary structural information for all four ribosomal RNAs and 32 additional noncoding RNAs. We further show that Mod-seq can be used to detect structural changes in 5.8S and 25S rRNAs in the absence of ribosomal protein L26, correctly identifying its binding site on the ribosome. While this method is applicable to RNAs of any length, its high-throughput nature makes Mod-seq ideal for studying long RNAs and complex RNA mixtures.

However, a lack of genome-wide in vivo RNA structural data has limited our understanding of how RNA structure regulates gene expression in living cells. Here we present a high-throughput, genome-wide in vivo RNA structure probing method, structure-seq, in which dimethyl sulphate methylation of unprotected adenines and cytosines is identified by next-generation sequencing. Application of this method to Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings yielded the first in vivo genome-wide RNA structure map at nucleotide resolution for any organism, with quantitative structural information across more than 10,000 transcripts. Our analysis reveals a three-nucleotide periodic repeat pattern in the structure of coding regions, as well as a less-structured region immediately upstream of the start codon, and shows that these features are strongly correlated with translation efficiency. We also find patterns of strong and weak secondary structure at sites of alternative polyadenylation, as well as strong secondary structure at 5′ splice sites that correlates with unspliced events. Notably, in vivo structures of messenger RNAs annotated for stress responses are poorly predicted in silico, whereas mRNA structures of genes related to cell function maintenance are well predicted. Global comparison of several structural features between these two categories shows that the mRNAs associated with stress responses tend to have more single-strandedness, longer maximal loop length and higher free energy per nucleotide, features that may allow these RNAs to undergo conformational changes in response to environmental conditions.

Here we present a novel biochemical approach, in vivo click selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation and profiling experiment (icSHAPE), which enables the first global view, to our knowledge, of RNA secondary structures in living cells for all four bases. icSHAPE of the mouse embryonic stem cell transcriptome versus purified RNA folded in vitro shows that the structural dynamics of RNA in the cellular environment distinguish different classes of RNAs and regulatory elements. Structural signatures at translational start sites and ribosome pause sites are conserved from in vitro conditions, suggesting that these RNA elements are programmed by sequence. In contrast, focal structural rearrangements in vivo reveal precise interfaces of RNA with RNA-binding proteins or RNA-modification sites that are consistent with atomic-resolution structural data. Such dynamic structural footprints enable accurate prediction of RNA–protein interactions and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification genome wide. These results open the door for structural genomics of RNA in living cells and reveal key physiological structures controlling gene expression.",GSE64169,10.1038/nature14263,NAI-N3,Chemical,Ribose 2'-OH,Single stranded,RT stop,In vivo and in vitro,Transcriptome-wide,Secondary,18S and 28S rRNA,Mouse,<img alt='icshape fig1' src='../images/icshape.jpg'>,4616950067260

Salama, Anders Krogh, and Jeppe Vinther ","Selective 2′ Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE) is an accurate method for probing of RNA secondary structure. In existing SHAPE methods, the SHAPE probing signal is normalized to a no-reagent control to correct for the background caused by premature termination of the reverse transcriptase. Here, we introduce a SHAPE Selection (SHAPES) reagent, N-propanone isatoic anhydride (NPIA), which retains the ability of SHAPE reagents to accurately probe RNA structure, but also allows covalent coupling between the SHAPES reagent and a biotin molecule. We demonstrate that SHAPES-based selection of cDNA–RNA hybrids on streptavidin beads effectively removes the large majority of background signal present in SHAPE probing data and that sequencing-based SHAPES data contain the same amount of RNA structure data as regular sequencing-based SHAPE data obtained through normalization to a no-reagent control. Moreover, the selection efficiently enriches for probed RNAs, suggesting that the SHAPES strategy will be useful for applications with high-background and low-probing signal such as in vivo RNA structure probing.

Targeted Structure-seq,2015,_NA_,Probing Xist RNA Structure in Cells Using Targeted Structure-Seq,"Fang R, Moss WN, Rutenberg-Schoenberg M, Simon MD","The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Xist is a master regulator of X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. Models for how Xist and other lncRNAs function depend on thermodynamically stable secondary and higher-order structures that RNAs can form in the context of a cell. Probing accessible RNA bases can provide data to build models of RNA conformation that provide insight into RNA function, molecular evolution, and modularity. To study the structure of Xist in cells, we built upon recent advances in RNA secondary structure mapping and modeling to develop Targeted Structure-Seq, which combines chemical probing of RNA structure in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing. By enriching for signals from the RNA of interest, Targeted Structure-Seq achieves high coverage of the target RNA with relatively few sequencing reads, thus providing a targeted and scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells. We use this approach to probe the full-length Xist lncRNA to develop new models for functional elements within Xist, including the repeat A element in the 5’-end of Xist. This analysis also identified new structural elements in Xist that are evolutionarily conserved, including a new element proximal to the C repeats that is important for Xist function.",GSE67667,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005668,DMS,Chemical,"N1A, N3C","Unpaired, unprotected, flexible, or GU wobble",RT stop,In vivo,Single-molecule,Secondary,18S rRNA,Murine (Mus musculus),<img alt='targeted structure-seq fig1b' src='../images/targeted-structure-seq.jpg'>,CC BY 4.0

A central goal of molecular and synthetic biology is to uncover design principles linking RNA structure to function to understand and engineer this relationship. Here we report a simple, high-throughput method called in-cell SHAPE-Seq that combines in-cell probing of RNA structure with a measurement of gene expression to simultaneously characterize RNA structure and function in bacterial cells. We use in-cell SHAPE-Seq to study the structure–function relationship of two RNA mechanisms that regulate translation in Escherichia coli. We find that nucleotides that participate in RNA–RNA interactions are highly accessible when their binding partner is absent and that changes in RNA structure due to RNA–RNA interactions can be quantitatively correlated to changes in gene expression. We also characterize the cellular structures of three endogenously expressed non-coding RNAs: 5S rRNA, RNase P and the btuB riboswitch. Finally, a comparison between in-cell and in vitro folded RNA structures revealed remarkable similarities for synthetic RNAs, but significant differences for RNAs that participate in complex cellular interactions.

Here, we develop PARIS, a method based on reversible psoralen crosslinking for global mapping of RNA duplexes with near base-pair resolution in living cells. PARIS analysis in three human and mouse cell types reveals frequent long-range structures, higher-order architectures, and RNA-RNA interactions in trans across the transcriptome. PARIS determines base-pairing interactions on an individual-molecule level, revealing pervasive alternative conformations. We used PARIS-determined helices to guide phylogenetic analysis of RNA structures and discovered conserved long-range and alternative structures. XIST, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) essential for X chromosome inactivation, folds into evolutionarily conserved RNA structural domains that span many kilobases. XIST A-repeat forms complex inter-repeat duplexes that nucleate higher-order assembly of the key epigenetic silencing protein SPEN.

We present a high-throughput approach, sequencing of psoralen crosslinked, ligated, and selected hybrids (SPLASH), that maps pairwise RNA interactions in vivo with high sensitivity and specificity, genome-wide. Applying SPLASH to human and yeast transcriptomes revealed the diversity and dynamics of thousands of long-range intra- and intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions. Our analysis highlighted key structural features of RNA classes, including the modular organization of mRNAs, its impact on translation and decay, and the enrichment of long-range interactions in noncoding RNAs. Additionally, intermolecular mRNA interactions were organized into network clusters and were remodeled during cellular differentiation. We also identified hundreds of known and new snoRNA-rRNA binding sites, expanding our knowledge of rRNA biogenesis.

DMS-MaPseq yields a high signal-to-noise ratio, can report multiple structural features per molecule, and allows both genome-wide studies and focused in vivo investigations of even low-abundance RNAs. We apply DMS-MaPseq for the first analysis of RNA structure within an animal tissue and to identify a functional structure involved in noncanonical translation initiation.
